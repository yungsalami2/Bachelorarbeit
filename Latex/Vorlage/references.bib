abstract = {A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

              Understanding the loss of coherence is paramount for future

              of a single central spin (a nitrogen-vacancy center) coupled to a
              bath of spins (nitrogen impurities) in diamond. Our experiments
              show that both the internal interactions of the bath and the
              coupling between the central spin and the bath can be tuned in
              situ, allowing access to regimes with surprisingly different
              behavior. The observed dynamics are well explained by analytics
              and numerical simulations, leading to valuable insight into the
              loss of coherence in spin systems. These measurements demonstrate

  abstract = "Spin is a fundamental property of all elementary particles.
              Classically it can be viewed as a tiny magnetic moment, but a
              measurement of an electron spin along the direction of an
              external magnetic field can have only two outcomes: parallel or
              anti-parallel to the field. This discreteness reflects the
              quantum mechanical nature of spin. Ensembles of many spins have
              found diverse applications ranging from magnetic resonance
              imaging to magneto-electronic devices, while individual spins are
              considered as carriers for quantum information. Read-out of
              single spin states has been achieved using optical techniques,
              and is within reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy.
              However, electrical read-out of single spins has so far remained
              elusive. Here we demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement
              of the state of an individual electron spin in a semiconductor
              quantum dot. We use spin-to-charge conversion of a single
              electron confined in the dot, and detect the single-electron
              charge using a quantum point contact; the spin measurement
              visibility is approximately 65\%. Furthermore, we observe very
              long single-spin energy relaxation times (up to approximately
              0.85 ms at a magnetic field of 8 T), which are encouraging for
              the use of electron spins as carriers of quantum information.",

We show, however, that the nuclei in singly charged quantum dots act constructively by focusing the electron spin precession about a magnetic field into well-defined modes synchronized with a laser pulse protocol. In a dot with a synchronized electron, the light-stimulated fluctuations of the hyperfine nuclear field acting on the electron are suppressed. The information about electron spin precession is imprinted in the nuclei and thereby can be stored for tens of minutes in darkness. The frequency focusing drives an electron spin ensemble into dephasing-free subspaces with the potential to realize single frequency precession of the entire ensemble.},

  title     = "Note on exchange phenomena in the Thomas atom",
  author    = "Dirac, P A M",
  abstract  = "For dealing with atoms involving many electrons the accurate
               quantum theory, involving a solution of the wave equation in
               many-dimensional space, is far too complicated to be
               practicable. One must therefore resort to approximate methods.
               The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent
               field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to
               deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still
               simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas'
               atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a
               perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the
               region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase
               space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with
               opposite spins in each volume (2$\pi$h)3, and the remainder is
               assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been
               justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible
               approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may
               expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of
               electric charge there.",

These are: the McLachlan variational principle, the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle and the time-dependent variational principle. We show that if the manifold can be parametrized by pairs of “complementary” parameters, the abovementioned principles are equivalent. The condition of complementarity, which is a sufficient one, is demonstrated to be satisfied in a number of important applications. However, a case of non-equivalence in the recent literature warns against liberal assumptions about the equivalence of the time-dependent variational principles.}

  abstract  = "A variational method is described for finding approximate
               solutions of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. It is
               closely related to Frenkel's, but better in some respects
               because it always leads to a true minimum of the error. For
               several interacting systems it leads to the time-dependent
               Hartree equations; for a system in an oscillating electric or
               magnetic field it gives a variational principle for calculating
               the susceptibility at any frequency.",
